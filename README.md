# Gif Finder :movie_camera:

## Project Overview
The Gif Finder is a React.js application which allows users to search for a Gif using the [GIPHY API](https://developers.giphy.com/), which I created at the start of my React.js journey.

### Inspiration
The original application was inspired by the Treehouse workshop, [Data Fetching in React](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/data-fetching-in-react). This was also a part of my **100 Days of Code Challenge** with Team Treehouse.
