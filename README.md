# Gif Finder :movie_camera:

## Project Overview
The Gif finder is a React.js application which allows for users to search for a Gif using the GIPHY API, which I created at the start of my React.js journey. The application is based off of a Treehouse tutorial which can be accessed [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/data-fetching-in-react). This is also a part of my 1<sup>st</sup> round of the **100 Days of Code Challenge**.

## Inital Work
The inital work was completed by following along the with the Treehouse workshop, with some small edits along the way.
